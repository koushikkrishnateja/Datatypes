          -fulfilled state
          -rejected state
        

      *********************
      not:- javascript is by default "Synchronous(single threaded)".
      - it means that it can only perform one task at a time.
let x = new Promise((resolve , reject)=>{});
  to execute the promise we have  instance methods;
  then ():-it is used to excute success or fulfilled results
  catch() :- it is used to '
